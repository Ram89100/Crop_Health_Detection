        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. Apple scab is caused by the fungus *Venturia inaequalis*, which infects the leaves, fruit, and stems of apple trees. 
        <br/> 2. The fungus overwinters on infected leaves and buds, and infection is favored by wet, cool conditions in spring. 
        <br/> 3. Initial symptoms appear as small, olive-green spots on the upper side of leaves. Over time, these spots turn darker and can lead to premature leaf drop.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Rake and destroy fallen leaves to reduce the fungal inoculum. 
        <br/>2. Use fungicides during the growing season to prevent infection, especially during wet weather.
